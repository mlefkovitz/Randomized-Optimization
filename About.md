### This directory contains one subfolder:
- /ABAGAIL-master/

I edited the files in the ABAGAIL directory directly. All of my edits can be found in the /ABAGAIL-master/jython/ directory.

The main python script used in part 1 is Abagail_nn.py. The data files can be found in the  /ABAGAIL-master/src/opt/test/ directory.

For part 2 of the assignment, I edited the following scripts:

- countones.py
- travelingsalesman.py
- knapsack.py
